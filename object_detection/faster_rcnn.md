- [Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01497v3.pdf)
- In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their convolutional featuresâ€”using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with "attention" mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look.
